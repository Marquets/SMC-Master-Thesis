# What is the motivation of this project?

Since the creation of the MIDI protocol and the first synthesizers, the largemajority of digital musical instrumentshave been keyboard-based. This approach has  therefore  helped  expand the  musical possibilities of keyboard players, given that they only need a MIDI keyboard and a computer to start making music. However, this approach has usually been framed within the western tonal system, which has sometimes led to some musical limitations. This Masterâ€™s Thesis is aimed at  creating a new digital musical instrument allowing the same level of expressiveness as string instruments (vibrato, slide, picking...) and having the flexibility  provided by controllers usually found in keyboard syn-thesizers. Moreover, this project explores how different scales from different cultures (such as well-tempered scale, polychromatic scales and microtonal scales) can be integrated within the same device in order to create aflexible and versatile instrument
